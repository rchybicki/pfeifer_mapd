# Openpilot mapd
Provides openpilot with data from mapd

## Using
### Integrating With Openpilot
Each release will have a pre-compiled static binary attached for use with
openpilot on a comma device. Without any additional code the binary will not run
or change openpilot behavior. A reference implementation for managing downloads
of the binary and using data output from this daemon is located in
[pfeifer-openpilot-patches](https://github.com/pfeiferj/openpilot/tree/pfeifer-openpilot-patches/mapd).

### mapd inputs
Inputs are described in [docs/inputs.md](./docs/inputs.md).

### mapd outputs
Outputs are described in [docs/outputs.md](./docs/outputs.md).
